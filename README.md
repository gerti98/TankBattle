**Tank Battle** is a Java game inspired by the popular NES game *Battle City*. It is a Project Assignment for the Advanced Programming Exam.

There are two different *Netbeans* project in the repository:
* ServerLogTankBattle: captures log events by creating a TCP connection with the main application
* TankBattle: the game itself

The application is linked to a database (see *tankbattle_dump.sql*) and there are many options configurable in `/TankBattle/configurazione.xml`.
